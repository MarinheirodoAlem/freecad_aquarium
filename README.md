# freecad_aquarium
This [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) extension is a tool to create a parametric drawing for a aquarium

## Install

First, download and install [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)

You have two options to install this extension:
* Via the FreeCAD [Addon Manager](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Addon_manager) (Recommended for users)
* Manually, cloning the [git repository](https://github.com/MarinheirodoAlem/freecad_aquarium) inside the Mod folder (Best option for developers)

### Install with addon manager

Inside FreeCAD, add this repository to the list of custom repositories following those steps:

1. Choose menu **Edit/Preferences/Addon Manager**
2. Add the url *https://github.com/MarinheirodoAlem/freecad_aquarium* and the branch *release* to the list
3. Open the addon manager with **Tools/Addon Manager**
4. Find and install this addon from the list.

## Usage

Use this tool to generate the desired parts inside a FreeCAD document.

1. Install the extension if not done it already
2. Open a document or create a new one
3. Choose the Aquarium workbench
4. Choose the option to create the desired feature.

For instance, **Aquarium Generation/Structure**
![Example of Generated Structure](images/1_structure.png)

This step create a structure to support the weight inside a group *StandStructure*

**Aquarium Generation/Structure Panels**
![Example of Generated Panels](images/2_panels.png)

This will create one option to fasten panel inside a group names *StandPanels*

**Aquarium Generation/Leveling Base**
![Example of Generated Base](images/3_base.png)

This base is used to distribute the weight of the glass in the structure, and it weight is used to hide part of the flange away from the structure, avoiding collisions.
Show and hide the parts and inspect if there is enough room around every part in order to prevent collisions. Pay special attention to the flanges, all parameters will change depending on the real flange that you choosed.

**Aquarium Generation/Glass Panels**
![Example of Generated Glass](images/4_glass.png)

Skip the Weir for now. Lets create it in the end of the example, because it is not optimized and FreeCAD take a long time to recompute it.

**Aquarium Generation/Flanges Pipes**
![Example of Generated Pipes](images/5_pipes.png)
**Aquarium Generation/ClosedLoop**
![Example of Generated Closed Loop](images/6_closed_loop.png)
**Aquarium Generation/Canopy**
![Example of Generated Canopy](images/7_canopy.png)
**Aquarium Generation/Canopy Panels**
![Example of Generated Canopy Panels](images/8_canopy_panels.png)
Now lets generate the Weir.
Since it is heavy to compute, it is a nice idea to enable the FreeCAD to allow to abort recomputation:
Choose Edit/Preferences/General/Document/**Allow aborting recomputation.**
**Aquarium Generation/Weir**
![Example of Generated Weir](images/9_weir.png)
Let's change the dimensions for a penninsula aquarium, to show the problems that you should be aware of when the plumbing collides with the structure.
**Aquarium Configuration/Structure**
Change the width to 800mm, and the length to 1500mm.
![Example of Configuration, external dimensions](images/10_config_dimensions.png)
You must check the project for inconsistencies, like the pipes colliding with the glass of the weir, like this:
![Example of inconsistent result](images/11_example_inconsistency.png)
This is one of the few cases where you can fix it with an option. choose **Aquarium Configuration/Plumbing**
Change *Number of spaces between beams to keep clean of nozzles after distribution* to **1**:
![Example of Generated Pipes](images/12_config_pipes.png)
Then you got a drawing that must be checked for any inconsistency. **This tool won't check if there is a collision, flanges donÂ´t fit, or the metal structure, glass or silicone bonding is too weak to support the weight and pressure**. Paper accepts everything printed on it (think toilet paper), but is up to you to figure out the materias and what can handle the load with a good margin of security, enough to give you peace of mind.
![End of the example](images/13_result.png)
Now you can use all the normal FreeCAD workflow to customize the drawing even further. The tool will dump a parametric drawing,
any configuration is made in spreadsheets, so with some luck you may be able generate, customize, and config your drawing, without having to
create the parts again after changing the parameters.
You may export the weir drawing in a format suitable to laser cut into acrylic panel.
For the metallic and glass parts, you can use the generate tech draw to create a drawing suitable to print and use it as a guide to build the project.
Using the structure as an example, lets build a drawing for the base:
Select **Blue Print Generation/BaseBluePrint**
![Example of blue print for the structure](images/14_blueprint.png)
Now switch to the Tech Draw Workbench and add the dimensions using the FreeCAD way, so you will have every dimension in the drawing.
In this example, some dimensions where added just to illustrate:
![Example of dimensions in drawing](images/15_techdraw_dimensions.png)
Now go ahead and try the same for the glass panels and the leveling base.
## Discussion/Feedback

# Development

## Guidelines

This tool tries to dump a parametric drawing and do not need to tweak with the drawing after created, all configuration should be in the parameters,
and the drawing should adjust itself. If you want to extend this tool and have you changes merged back, please make sure that this feature is preserved after
your changes.
